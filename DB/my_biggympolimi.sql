The Chinese pole, originating in India, uses two poles on which men would perform “gravity defying tricks” as they leap from pole to pole, at approximately twenty feet in the air, further information can be seen in the old vintage documentary series of mallakhamb, by yasho purush film on YouTube.\r\nIn the 1920s, traveling circuses and sideshows would utilize pole dancing with a pole in the middle of a tent. Eventually the pole dancing moved from tents to bars, and combined with burlesque dance. The earliest recorded pole dance was in 1968 with a performance by Belle Jangles at Mugwump Strip Club in Oregon. [7] Since the 1980s, the dance pole has increasingly been incorporated into striptease routines, and Go-Go or lap dancing, first in Canada and then in the United States. In the 1990s, pole dancing commenced to be taught as an art and use in fitness exercises. Since then, pole dancing classes have become a popular form of recreational and competitive sport. K.T. Coates, a famed competitive pole dancer, and the International Pole Sport Federation, are currently promoting a campaign to include competitive pole dance in the Olympics in 2016. Numerous competitions exist, including the World Pole Sport Championship, U.S. Pole Federation Championship, and the International Pole Masters Cup Championship.', 'Pole Dancing is a type of exercise that combines acrobatics, gymnastics and dance. It requires flexibility and upper body and core strength, as well as endurance. The moves include climbs, spins, inversions and limb grips, and thus is a very versatile form of exercise. Pole dance techniques are often combined with aerobics to improve your control and positioning on the pole, and making sure you are always getting the most of your workout.While in the West Pole Dance has been mostly associated with women, in the east it is a form of traditional acrobatics and entertainment practiced equally by men. In fact, China’s 2007 National Pole Dancing Competition was actually won by a man.', 'Pole dancing taxes the muscles in the entire body and you are always moving – making it a great isometric and cardiovascular exercise wrapped into one. You can burn as many calories in a 30-minute session as you would doing aerobics and calisthenics, and this will lead to significant weight loss over several months.\r\nOnce you get the basics down and strengthen your muscles a bit, you will quickly begin to develop some serious skills and a body that makes heads turn. Being confident isn’t just about your state of mind – you will actually start to walk tall and improve your posture. Your skills on the pole will translate into real life and you will be able to move with the nimbleness and graciousness of a cat.\r\nPeople often forget the importance of joint mobility and flexibility. As you become more limber you will have fewer problems like back pain, a stiff neck and muscle soreness. You will also minimize the risk of sprains and will be able to move more freely.\r\nThe benefits of pole dancing aren’t limited to developing a strong body. It can help you improve your mental and emotional health, prevent injuries and increase mobility, as well as give your social and love life a boost by making you more confident and agile. You should definitely give it a try.\r\nKinesthetic awareness is your brain’s ability to calculate where your body is located in three-dimensional space in relation to other objects around you. When you start performing more complex routines, your kinesthetic awareness increases. This means less chance of injuries due to bumping into stuff. Combined with good balance, increased kinesthetic awareness allows you to avoid nasty common accidents like slipping, falling, and knocking things over and having them fall on your feet, etc.\r\n\r\n', 'People of all shapes, sizes, experience levels and athletic capabilities can practice Pole Dancing. You can start at any level and work your way up as quickly or as slowly as you need to. It is important that you are in the right physical condition to work out and that your doctor is approving you doing this sort of exercise. Many studios have defined classes at different levels of experience, so you can work with people of your same skill level and improve together', '    -    |8am - 10pm|    -    |10pm - 10pm|    -    |10pm - 10pm|8am - 10pm', 'dance', 0),

UFC official Jeff Blatnick was responsible for the Ultimate Fighting Championship officially adopting the name mixed martial arts. Previously marketed as "Ultimate Fighting" and "No Holds Barred (NHB)", Blatnick and John McCarthy proposed the name ''MMA'' at the UFC 17 rules meeting in response to increased public criticism. The question on who actually coined the name is a question still in debate.', 'Mixed martial arts is a full-contact sport that combines different fighting styles, including karate, boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, Vale Tudo, Muay Thai and Brazilian Ju jitsu.', ':( SORRY NO INFO AVAILABLE', ':( SORRY NO INFO AVAILABLE', '    -    |8am - 10pm|    -    |10pm - 10pm|    -    |10pm - 10pm|8am - 10pm', 'combat', 0),

Lichtenfeld became active in a wide range of sports, including gymnastics, wrestling, and boxing. In 1928, Lichtenfeld won the Slovakian Youth Wrestling Championship, and in 1929 the adult championship (light and middle weight divisions). That same year, he also won the national boxing championship and an international gymnastics championship. During the ensuing decade, Imi''s athletic activities focused mainly on wrestling, both as a contestant and a trainer.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1930s, anti-Semitic riots began to threaten the Jews of Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. (The country was created from parts of Austro-Hungary in 1918- a result of World War l) Lichtenfeld became the leader of a group of Jewish boxers and wrestlers who took to the streets to defend Jewish neighborhoods against the growing numbers of national socialist party and anti-Semitic thugs. Lichtenfeld quickly discovered, however, that actual fighting was very different from competition fighting, and although boxing and wrestling were good sports, they were not always practical for the aggressive and brutal nature of street combat. It was then that he started to re-evaluate his ideas about fighting and started developing the skills and techniques that would eventually become Krav Maga. Having become a thorn in the side of the equally anti-Semitic local authorities, Lichtenfeld left his home, family and friends in 1940 on the last refugee ship to escape Europe.', 'Krav Maga  ("contact combat") is a self-defense system developed for the military in Israel that consists of a wide combination of techniques sourced from Aikido, Boxing, Judo and Wrestling along with realistic fight training [1][2] Krav Maga is known for its focus on real-world situations and its extremely efficient[3][4] and brutal counter-attacks.[5] It was derived from street-fighting skills developed by Hungarian-Israeli martial artist Imi Lichtenfeld, who made use of his training as a boxer and wrestler as a means of defending the Jewish quarter against fascist groups in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia [6] in the mid-to-late 1930s. In the late 1940s, following his immigration to Israel, he began to provide lessons on combat training to what was to become the IDF, who went on to develop the system that became known as Krav Maga. It has since been refined for civilian, police and military applications.[7]\n\nKrav Maga has a philosophy emphasizing threat neutralization, simultaneous defensive and offensive maneuvers, and aggression. Krav Maga has been used mainly by Israeli Defense Forces, special units and reconnaissance brigades and recently by regular infantry brigades, and several closely related variations have been developed and adopted by law enforcement and intelligence organizations, Mossad and Shin Bet. There are several organizations teaching variations of Krav Maga internationally.', ':( SORRY NO INFO AVAILABLE', ':( SORRY NO INFO AVAILABLE', '    -    |8am - 10pm|    -    |10pm - 10pm|    -    |10pm - 10pm|8am - 10pm', 'combat', 0);
